# Text Editor PWA

## About

This is a simple browser based text editor Progressive Web App (PWA). The app uses both IndexedDB and Localstorage for persistent data. The application will first look for data stored in indexedDb, but if there is none it will then look in localStorage to populate the editor when it is loaded. Being a PWA, the app is also available for use offline and can be installed locally on the user's device. This application can be useful if you just need to quickly jot down a code idea or snippet, or you don't have access to a different text editor.
